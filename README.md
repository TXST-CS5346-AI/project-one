## Reports

Reports for all team members are located under:     
`resources/reports` directory. 

To navigate there, cd into the directory: 

`cd resources/reports`

## 1. Technical Specifications
<hr>

![Code quality grade](https://www.code-inspector.com/project/19629/score/svg)

### 1.1 Build and run the application 

This application is primarily designed to run on Texas State (TXST) Linux servers. 
Eros: EROS.CS.TXSTATE.EDU (147.26.231.153)
Zeus: ZEUS.CS.TXSTATE.EDU (147.26.231.156)

Upon invoking the program, the knowledge base (KB) file will be parsed and if correctly formatted, each statement (line) will be processed and displayed to the console.

### 1.2 Automated build with log file

Simply run the below command from the root directory:     
 `./buildAndRun.sh`

After a complete run, log will be in root dir as `vehicle_diagnosis.log`

### 1.3 Manual build (no log) 

To build locally, run this command in the root directory: `make`

To see the help menu:     
`./VehicleRepairAndDiagnosis -h` OR     
`./VehicleRepairAndDiagnosis -help`

To run: `./VehicleRepairAndDiagnosis`

Once KB file is loaded and variables list parsed, user is prompted for a conclusion.     
Upon entering a conclusion, the user will be prompted with questions until a solution is found (if available). 

### 1.4 Loading the Knowledge Base 

### 1.5 Error handling 
This section intentionally shows what CLI output would look like, given a defective KB file.    
If, after loading the KB file, you see this message: 
![Error loading KB](resources/images/error_check_example_kb_validation_2.jpg)

Then scroll up and look through the readout (alternatively, look through the generated vehicle_diagnosis.log file) for a line like this: 
![Error loading KB](resources/images/error_check_example_kb_validation_1.jpg)

The KB file line must be corrected for correct processing. 

### 1.6 Normal operation 

Once the KB file is corrected, the output should look like this: 
![Error loading KB](resources/images/normal_operation_kb_no_error.jpg)

### 1.7 Using the application 

After the KB file is loaded, program will pause, allowing you to view output.     
Press Enter to continue. 

![Enter to continue](resources/images/enter_to_continue.jpg)

You'll be asked if you want to view the imported KB file in human readable form: 

![Display KB prompt](resources/images/display_kb_prompt.jpg)

If you select yes, KB will be printed to the console:

![Yes display KB](resources/images/yes_display_kb.jpg)

Otherwise program will continue. Regardless of the choice, after you either skip or print the KB, you'll be asked to enter a conclusion as shown above.  

The provided KB has two conclusions - issue and repair. If you select issue, follow the prompts as shown in this example: 

![Issue conclusion](resources/images/issue_conclusion.jpg)

If you select repair, follow the prompts as shown in this example: 

![Repair conclusion](resources/images/repair_conclusion.jpg)


## 2. Design 
<hr>

### 2.1 Decision Tree Diagram 

The application comes with a pre-defined knowledge base for a vehicle repair and diagnosys system. 

![Decision tree diagram](resources/images/CS5346_Decision_Tree.png)

### 2.2 Variables 

46 variables are used in the provided knowledge base. 

For a complete listing of all variables and their purpose, refer to [this list](resources/docs/Variables_for_Decision_Tree.xlsx) under `resources/docs/Variables_ForDecisionTree.xslx`. 

The premise variables are designed to be boolean type only.     
Each question is intentionally phrased as a yes or no question. For example, instead of asking the user to enter in the battery voltage as a number, the user is asked only - "Is sufficient voltage available in the battery (Y/n)?" 

The reason is because each battery manufacturer may have different voltage requirements. The user must refer to their user manual and determine the value. 

As an additional example - instead of asking the user to input their GPA and have the system determine whether it is above or below a certain treshold, the question would ask the student directly if their GPA is above a certain value (e.g., "Is your GPA above 3.5 (Y/n)?") 

This simplifies the design and the user experience, allowing the user to enter only yes or no for each question. 

### Class relationships 

BackChain has a VariableListItem and a KnowledgeBase    
ForwardChain has a VariableListItem, a KnowledgeBase, and ClauseItem (via queue)    
KnowledgeBase has a Statement     
Statement has a ClauseItem

###  2.3 Why C++11? 

A small aside but worth mentioning. Why use c++11 compiler? C++11 now supports:

- lambda expressions,   
- automatic type deduction of objects,   
- uniform initialization syntax,   
- delegating constructors,   
- deleted and defaulted function declarations,    
- nullptr,     
- rvalue references   
 
"The C++11 Standard Library was also revamped with new algorithms, new container classes, atomic operations, type traits, regular expressions, new smart pointers, async() facility, and of course a multithreading library"
